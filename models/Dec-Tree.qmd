playlist_dectree_wf <- workflow() %>%
  add_recipe(music_recipe) %>%
  add_model(playlist_dectree_spec %>%
              set_args(cost_complexity = tune()))

playlist_dt_param_grid <- grid_regular(cost_complexity(range = c(-3, -1)), levels = 10)

playlist_dt_tune_res <- tune_grid(
  playlist_dectree_wf, 
  resamples = playlist_folds, 
  grid = playlist_dt_param_grid, 
  metrics = metric_set(yardstick::roc_auc)
)

```

```{r}
